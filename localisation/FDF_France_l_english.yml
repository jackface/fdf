 france.1.t:0 "Home of The Revolution"
 france.1.d:0 "In recent history France has been dominated by their revolution, a revolution that has inspired the same throughout the world in many different ways. Maximilien Robespierre the founding father of France lead the revolution and defended France from opportunists and outside forces such as the Thermidorians and Ancien Coalitions. While he was a dictator for a time, he truly believed in the ideals of democracy but believed that society needs to be cleansed of counter revolutionary forces before a democracy can truly flourish. Upon his death he appointed Marshall of France, and second in command of the Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte as successor with a set of guidelines. The most important of these guidelines was the establishment of a proper democratic system. Bonaparte enacted many democratic reforms heavily inspired by Robespierre's own writings as well as the American constitution and the Roman Republic; Bonaparte served two seven year terms and stepped down. The Republic continued to flourish and then finally the Great Scramble For Africa had begun, European powers all tried to make their claims in the continent but most powerful and successful was France who had taken massive gains in Africa.\n\nThe French Republic stood strong and made many friends in the world; eventually making friends with the Hapsburg's who had once been regarded as enemies of the French and their Republic but was now seen as a vital ally in a changing world. France helped her new ally to unite the Southern German people to oppose the forces of the north under Prussian dominance creating a great strain between the Northern Germans and French. The strain between the two would see a massive showdown in the Great War, a war which lasted between 1913 and 1919 and saw many world powers fight against each other. France, Southern Germany, Britain, Mexico, Russia, The Ottomans, and more were all allied together against an alliance lead by the Northern Germans; eventually a conflict arose between the British and French and the British and a few allies broke off from the French alliance and tried and failed to join the Germans; this breach would be the downfall of Britain and her allies. The War officially ended in 1920 and saw various treaties with various gains for the French, in Africa, India, the Pacific, and even in Europe. Now five years have passed since the treaties of the Great War had been signed, France has rebuilt ruined infrastructure and is flourishing; however, the post war government of the Girondins have held dominance with their victory in the Great War but they have lead with a naive view. Some hope the naive view of the government is something that won't be the downfall of the Republic while some hope that it will allow for events to happen which will allow for a fragile France to fall right into their hands...\n\nVive la France, Vive la Revolution, Vive la Republique."

 france.2.t:0 "Treaty of Zuerich Expiration"
 france.2.d:0 "The Treaty of Zuerich signed in 1890 was meant to be the creation of a military and economic alliance between the signers; France, Spain, Helvetica, and Portugal. Initially the treaty was set to expire in 1920 but was extended by five years after the planned expiration conference, Portugal did not join in the extension. Now the treaty is set to expire again and the last conference in Barcelona, Spain and Helvetica expressed that an extension of the treaty was not in their best interest at the time. However this does not mean that a deal can not be worked out between our three nations at the expiration conference in a few weeks, or we can cut our losses and send our farewells and best wishes to the leaders of our allies."
